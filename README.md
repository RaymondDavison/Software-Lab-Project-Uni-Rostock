# Software-Lab-Project-Uni-Rostock

This project is about the Visualization and characterization of marine animal trajectories. The Animals, Seals, were tracked with GPS devices and information relating to their location such as longitude and latitudes over time recorded. Parameters such as trajectories, mean speed, straightness index, Sinuosity and Fractal Dimension are of interest. Totally, 27 Seals were tracked but this analysis is done on 4 seals (G17, G20, S11, & S12) selected based on tracking duration. Longer durations were of interest because they provided more details and hence more meaningful analysis. It is worth mentioning that this report closely follows the work of D. McLean and V. M. Skowron [1] and most of the methods and definitions are unedited while Traja and Trajr documentations were also consulted. The First part of the Project is focused on cleaning the Data with python and plotting Trajectories with with Traja a python Package developed by Justin Shenk and RÃ¼diger Busche
